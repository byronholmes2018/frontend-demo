# Clone Repo and Install Dependencies

After you clone it to your machine, cd into your directory and 

### `yarn` 


## Clone Backend Repo 

Open a second terminal window and clone  [backend repo](https://github.com/byronholmes2018/backend-demo) to view it in the browser.



## Start Backend

After following the instructions there, start the backend first. This is so it will run on port 3000 which will match the proxy specified in the package.json of this repo. 

## Start Frontend

From your original terminal window (the one where you cloned this repo from), cd into the frontend-demo directory (if you're not already there) and 

### `yarn`

You should now have a frontend and backend running with frontend making requests to backend. Enjoy!
